CLI PROJECT

CLI PROJECT is a ruby program that requires command line interface interaction (thus the name).  It demonstrates OOP, DRY, and SRP.

Description: The program provides either a list of photographers to choose from or a random photographer which it then displays the photographer name, photographer URL and the URL of an original picture.
